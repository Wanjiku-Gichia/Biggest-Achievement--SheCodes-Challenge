      <p>
        "I'm so proud of myself for finishing the SheCodes Plus program this
        month! It wasn’t easy, but I managed to build a weather app that
        actually works (yes, really!). I went from barely knowing how to write
        code to creating something useful, and I couldn't be happier. Now I can
        check the weather without even leaving my code – how cool is that?"
